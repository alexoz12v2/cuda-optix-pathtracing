# Streaming Scenes to GPU
## Scene Data Structure
The scene typically consists of various elements such as:
- Geometry (meshes, triangles, etc.)
- Textures (images, procedural textures)
- Lights (light sources)
- Materials (shaders, BRDFs)
- Acceleration structures (BVH, grids)

You need to consider how to partition these elements into manageable chunks that can be streamed from disk and 
loaded into memory incrementally.

## Disk Streaming Strategy
You can stream the scene in a way that allows you to load parts of it as needed, based on the 
path tracing algorithm's progress. The general approach would involve:

- Chunking the scene: Divide the scene into smaller parts 
  (e.g., individual objects, clusters of objects, or regions of the scene).
- Lazy loading: Load scene data only when it's required by the renderer 
  (e.g., when a ray intersects a particular object or region).
- Asynchronous loading: Use asynchronous I/O to load scene data in parallel with rendering to 
  avoid stalling the GPU.
## Asynchronous Loading
Since loading scene data from disk is relatively slow compared to GPU computations, you can use 
asynchronous loading to ensure that the CPU is not blocked while the GPU is rendering.
- Asynchronous I/O: Use multi-threading or CUDA streams to load scene data asynchronously from disk.
This can be done using standard OS file I/O or CUDA-specific asynchronous memory copy functions.
- CUDA Streams: Use CUDA streams to manage asynchronous operations. For example, you can copy data 
to the GPU in one stream while rendering in another.
- Memory Paging: If the scene data is too large to fit in memory, implement a paging system to 
swap data in and out of memory as needed.

## Loading and Caching Scene Data
You can implement a caching system to keep the most recently used scene data in memory. 
For example:
- LRU Cache: Use a least-recently-used (LRU) cache to store recently accessed scene data in system memory. When data is needed, first check the cache; if it's not found, load it from disk.
- Memory Pooling: Use a memory pool to pre-allocate a block of memory for scene data. When an object or region of the scene is needed, load it into the pool and reuse it.

## Loading Acceleration Structures
The BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) or other acceleration structures are critical for 
ray tracing performance. These structures can also be too large to fit in memory, so they need 
to be streamed efficiently:

- Incremental BVH Construction: If you cannot load the entire BVH at once, 
  consider using an incremental approach to build the BVH on the fly. This means 
  loading only the parts of the BVH that are needed for the current rays being traced.
- Streaming BVH: Store the BVH in a format that allows it to be streamed in parts. 
  You can load and process the BVH nodes as they are needed during the path tracing process.
4. Path Tracing with Streaming
   During path tracing, you'll need to determine which parts of the scene are required for each ray:

Ray Intersection: For each ray, determine which objects it intersects. If the object is not yet in memory, load it from disk.
Lazy Loading: Load the geometry, textures, and materials of the object only when needed. This ensures that you're not loading unnecessary data.
Async Loading: While tracing rays, use asynchronous I/O to load additional scene data in parallel with the rendering process. For example, while one ray is being traced, another part of the scene can be loaded.
5. Example Workflow
   Hereâ€™s an example of how the process could work:

Initialization:

Load the scene index (e.g., a list of object bounding boxes, textures, and materials).
Set up a cache for the scene data (geometry, materials, textures).
Rendering:

For each ray, check if the object it intersects is already in memory.
If not, initiate an asynchronous disk read to load the required data into memory (system or GPU memory).
Once the data is loaded, continue the ray tracing process.
Post-Processing:

After rendering, if you need to reload data for further processing (e.g., for another frame or for post-processing), repeat the process of streaming the scene.
6. Challenges and Optimizations
   Latency: Disk I/O can introduce latency, which may affect performance. To mitigate this, you can pre-fetch data or use double buffering to load scene data in parallel with rendering.
   Memory Management: Managing memory between system RAM and GPU memory can be tricky. Consider using unified memory or explicit memory management techniques to ensure that the data is available when needed.
   Data Compression: You can compress scene data on disk to reduce I/O time, though this adds additional overhead during decompression.
   Summary
   To stream a large scene from disk in a CUDA OptiX path tracing application, you need to:

Partition the scene into smaller chunks (objects, regions, or BVH nodes).
Lazy load the scene data from disk as needed, using asynchronous I/O and efficient memory management.
Cache frequently accessed data to avoid redundant disk reads.
Use CUDA streams to overlap GPU computation with disk I/O, ensuring that the GPU is not idle while waiting for data.
This approach allows you to handle large scenes that cannot fit entirely in memory, enabling efficient path tracing even with complex and large-scale scenes.
